    <h1>Keeping It Secure: A Fun Take on Data Privacy at TCS</h1>

    <p>Yesterday’s event was a blast! Our team brought data privacy and security to life with a fun, engaging, and slightly <em>eye-opening</em> skit session. Through four short but impactful scenes, we highlighted common security mistakes that can put sensitive information at risk—while making sure everyone had a good laugh along the way!</p>

    <h2>Secrets in the Trash</h2>
    <p>We kicked off with <strong>“Secrets in the Trash”</strong>, where an associate casually tossed confidential documents into the bin—only for someone to retrieve them like buried treasure. Lesson? <strong>Shred it, don’t spread it!</strong></p>

    <h2>Left Unlocked</h2>
    <p>Next was <strong>“Left Unlocked”</strong>, where an employee left their laptop open and unattended. A golden opportunity for someone to step in and access sensitive files. Moral of the story? <strong>Lock it before you leave it!</strong></p>

    <h2>The Open Secret</h2>
    <p>Then came the crowd favorite, <strong>“The Open Secret”</strong>, featuring an associate discussing confidential client details loudly in the cafeteria. Eavesdroppers got all the juicy details—no hacking needed! As we wrapped up, we reminded everyone:</p>
    <blockquote><strong>"The cafeteria is for chai and chills, not for data spills!"</strong></blockquote>

    <h2>The Password Mistake</h2>
    <p>Finally, <strong>“The Password Mistake”</strong> showed why sharing credentials—even with colleagues—is a big no-no. Because let’s face it, your password is <strong>yours</strong>, not a group project!</p>

    <p>The event was filled with laughter, surprises, and most importantly, valuable takeaways. Data security isn’t just an IT thing—it’s everyone’s responsibility!</p>

    <p>A big shoutout to the team for making this both fun and insightful. Until next time, <strong>stay safe, stay secure!</strong></p>
