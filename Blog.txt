Keeping It Secure: A Fun Take on Data Privacy at TCS

Yesterday’s event was a blast! Our team brought data privacy and security to life with a fun, engaging, and slightly eye-opening skit session. Through four short but impactful scenes, we highlighted common security mistakes that can put sensitive information at risk—while making sure everyone had a good laugh along the way!

We kicked off with “Secrets in the Trash”, where an associate casually tossed confidential documents into the bin—only for someone to retrieve them like buried treasure. Lesson? Shred it, don’t spread it!

Next was “Left Unlocked”, where an employee left their laptop open and unattended. A golden opportunity for someone to step in and access sensitive files. Moral of the story? Lock it before you leave it!

Then came the crowd favorite, “The Open Secret”, featuring an associate discussing confidential client details loudly in the cafeteria. Eavesdroppers got all the juicy details—no hacking needed! As we wrapped up, we reminded everyone: "The cafeteria is for chai and chills, not for data spills!"

Finally, “The Password Mistake” showed why sharing credentials—even with colleagues—is a big no-no. Because let’s face it, your password is yours, not a group project!

The event was filled with laughter, surprises, and most importantly, valuable takeaways. Data security isn’t just an IT thing—it’s everyone’s responsibility!

A big shoutout to the team for making this both fun and insightful. Until next time, stay safe, stay secure! 🚀
