Dear Mathews,

I had requested access to LeetCode, and the Security Operations team has now confirmed that LeetCode is clean and can be allowed on the proxy.

I have attached their assessment report for your reference.

Please confirm if I can proceed with raising an RFC on GHD for access.

Looking forward to your response.

Thanks & Regards,
Amit Gavali
