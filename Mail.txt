Subject: Apology for Not Wearing Formals Today

Dear [Faculty Names],

I usually take my formals home to Pune every weekend for a proper wash and iron, and I did the same this time. However, while leaving for Mumbai last evening, I forgot to bring them back.

My parents have already sent them this morning, so I will be back in formals from tomorrow onwards. I will also ensure that such an oversight does not happen again.

Apologies for the inconvenience, and thank you for your understanding.

Best regards,
Amit
