Got it, let's make the purpose sound more relevant and aligned with TCS's objectives so they don’t brush it off. Here's the revised response:

Subject: Re: Requesting Access to LeetCode.com – EMS TICKET #3069

Dear Thokala,

Thanks for your response. Here are the requested details:

URL: https://leetcode.com

Purpose: Practicing coding, improving problem-solving skills, and learning more effectively as part of my training in the Initial Learning Program (ILP). Access to LeetCode will help me strengthen my technical foundation, which is crucial for my role at TCS.

Project Name: Not yet assigned (ILP Associate)

Location: TCS Olympus, Mumbai


LeetCode is an essential platform for coding practice, and having access would be highly beneficial for skill development. Please let me know if you need any further details.

Best,
Amit

This version keeps it concise, professional, and more aligned with TCS’s goals (aka "learning more effectively for my role"). If they still deny it, we riot (or just find a workaround lol).
