Subject: Requesting Access to LeetCode.com

Hello Team,

I usually solve LeetCode questions to enhance my Java skills, and it was accessible until a few days ago. Since I’m currently in the Initial Learning Program (ILP), practicing coding problems helps me improve my problem-solving skills and learn more effectively.

With LeetCode blocked, it’s been tricky to find the right problems on other platforms like GeeksforGeeks. I’d really appreciate it if you could reconsider allowing access to LeetCode, as it’s a valuable learning resource for me.

Looking forward to your response.

Best,
Amit

This keeps it polite, straightforward, and to the point—no unnecessary fluff, just facts. Also, framing it as "It was working before, now it's not" might make them think it was an accidental block.

Send it and let’s see what they say!
