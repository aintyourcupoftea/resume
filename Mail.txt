Subject: Re: LeetCode.com â€“ EMS TICKET #3069

Hi Team,

I require access to LeetCode for practicing coding and improving problem-solving skills.

I am currently in the Initial Learning Program (ILP) at TCS Olympus Mumbai and do not have a project assigned yet, so I am unable to provide a Project AD group name.

Please let me know if any further details are required.

Best regards,
Amit
